# classsimbot

I just started development on this bot that i hope can become an advanced world simulation bot (more specifically, a bot with an advanced economy that follows the user through their virtual life).

Wish me luck.

###Idea

The idea for this project is that the bot initializes data for a user when the person send the `birth` command, where they then are birthed. The bot then assigns the user to its "teen-years." During this time, the person can only use commands corresponding to tasks that are appropriate and make sense for their age. Then at some point, and the point may be designated either by a number of "jobs" the user has completed or whether they have "graduated" (thinking of making a `study` command that will involve the user pursuing educational training *in the bg*, and if they use this command they will enter a student level above teen-years), the user will level up to an adult level, or possibly a series of levels, maybe associated with each decade of life.

Another idea to add on to this is that the user is pursuing becoming rich before they die, and at the end it can be a twist where if the user is successful enough, they will "transcend" normal reality and ascend to a point where existence and mortality is beyond them, and they will be able to play and expand their financial empires as far as they want.

I'm thinking mongodb, not sure though, I will also have to address Stratum's current db, or maybe add on to it.
